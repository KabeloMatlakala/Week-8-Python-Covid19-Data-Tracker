# üåç COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis notebook that explores global COVID-19 trends over time, including cases, deaths, and vaccinations. Using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data), it demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize key metrics across multiple countries.

    cd Week-8-Python-Covid19-Data-Tracker
   ```
2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
        python -m venv .venv

        source .venv/bin/activate  
        
        # On Windows: 
        .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
        pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

4. Open the notebook in VS Code or with:
    ```bash
        jupyter notebook
    ```

## Data Source

Data used: [Our World in Data ‚Äì COVID-19 Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)  
- Included file: `owid-covid-data.csv.zip` (compressed for size)
- Original uncompressed dataset: [owid-covid-data.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)

### How to Use the Zip File

After cloning this repo:

1. **Manually extract** `owid-covid-data.csv.zip` using your system‚Äôs unzip tool (right-click ‚Üí Extract).
2. Place the extracted file `owid-covid-data.csv` in the project root (same folder as the notebook).
3. Then run the notebook.

Alternatively, you can extract it with Python:

```python
import zipfile

with zipfile.ZipFile("owid-covid-data.csv.zip", "r") as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall()
```
